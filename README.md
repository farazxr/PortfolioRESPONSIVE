This is a sample website showcasing a portfolio of mines and I've used HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT and made it little responsive for a better user experience.
Everytime before you start making a website I prefer to select color theme,Images,Layouts etc and coding is all about thinking then typing.

I messed up my code a lot of times by simple spelling mistakes which killed alot of my time.

Well I used VS Code as my IDE to make this website and I learnt many shortcuts in a short span of time and also learnt new syntaxes and used JS for first time to make a website responsive.
